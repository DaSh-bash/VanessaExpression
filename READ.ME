** Phylogentic relationships in the group - Figure 2 **
For phylogeny we planned to use one of the multispecies coalescent softwares and whole genome information.

Data/Method:
1. vcf files + Swainsson's thrush genome assembly can we used to produce consensus fasta's for each species
2. Using SNAPPER + ASTRAL for phylogeny

**Individual_Genes**: this folder also includes phylogenies for the core candidate genes created in geneious.
